# Certags Artwork Management App

Online portal to view and manage custom designs made for industrial grade tags/label orders. 

## Functionality

After being hired at Certags, I recognised that I could use my skills as a software developer to create something which would increase efficiency and productivity. Vast majority of customer orders require a bespoke artwork to be designed prior to print. Over time, these designs ended up being stored across different colleague's computers, on different folders. Whe team members were on annual leave, some artworks would not be easily accessible. Furthermore, in cases of new starters being onboarded into the business, they would need to ask existing team members for artwork every time a repeat order was placed.

This online portal solves these problems by organising information into a single, cloud based location.
