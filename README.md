# Certags Artwork Management App

Online portal to view and manage custom designs made for industrial grade tags/label orders. 

## Functionality

After being hired at Certags, I recognised that I could use my skills as a software developer to create something which would increase efficiency and productivity. The vast majority of customer orders require a bespoke artwork to be designed prior to print. Over time, these designs ended up being stored across different colleague's computers, on different folders. When team members were on annual leave, some artworks would not be easily accessible. Furthermore, in cases of new starters being onboarded into the business, they would need to ask existing team members for artwork every time a repeat order was placed.

This online portal solves these problems by organising information into a single, cloud based location.

 ## Features

  - Display all artworks
  - Upload and preview artwork
  - Search by company
  - Search by part number

  More features will be added based on user and stakeholder feedback.

  ## Additional features to come

  I have ideas to make this a go to sales platform. This is what I'm thinking of adding next:
  
   - Update artworks
   - Delete artworks
   - Display pricing
   - Email orders (to place a new order)
   - Email pricing (to request for pricing)
   - Email artwork (to request for new artwork or existing artwork amendments)
   - Sort by date
